        Please note that we do not control, and are not responsible for, other uses of your personal information by your third-party social media provider.
        We recommend that you review their privacy policy to understand how they collect, use and share your personal information, and how you can set your privacy preferences on their sites and apps.

      <h3><strong>5. IS YOUR INFORMATION TRANSFERRED INTERNATIONALLY?</strong></h3>

      <p><em><strong>In Short:  </strong>We may transfer, store, and process your information in countries other than your own.</em></p>

      <p>
        Our servers are located in only few countries.
        If you are accessing our App from outside, please be aware that your information may be transferred to, stored, and processed by us in our facilities and by those third parties with whom we may share your personal information (see <a
          href="#infoshare">"WILL YOUR INFORMATION BE SHARED WITH ANYONE?"</a> above), in and other countries.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you are a resident in the European Economic Area, then these countries may not necessarily have data protection laws or other similar laws as comprehensive as those in your country.
        We will however take all necessary measures to protect your personal information in accordance with this privacy policy and applicable law.

      <h3><strong>6. WHAT IS OUR STANCE ON THIRD-PARTY WEBSITES?</strong></h3>

      <p><em><strong>In Short:  </strong>We are not responsible for the safety of any information that you share with third-party providers who advertise, but are not affiliated with, our Website.</em></p>

      <p>
        The App may contain advertisements from third parties that are not affiliated with us and which may link to other websites, online services or mobile applications.
        We cannot guarantee the safety and privacy of data you provide to any third parties. Any data collected by third parties is not covered by this privacy policy.
        We are not responsible for the content or privacy and security practices and policies of any third parties, including other websites, services or applications that may be linked to or from the App.
        You should review the policies of such third parties and contact them directly to respond to your questions.

      <h3><strong>7. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</strong></h3>

      <p><em><strong>In Short:  </strong>We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this privacy policy unless otherwise required by law.</em></p>

      <p>
        We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy policy, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting or other legal
        requirements).
        No purpose in this policy will require us keeping your personal information for longer than the period of time in which users have an account with us.
      </p>

      <p>
        When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup
        archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.

      <h3><strong>8. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</strong></h3>

      <p><em><strong>In Short:  </strong>We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organizational and technical security measures.</em></p>

      <p>
        We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process.
        However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers,
        cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security, and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information.
        Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our App is at your own risk.
        You should only access the App within a secure environment.

      <h3><strong>9. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?</strong></h3>

      <p><em><strong>In Short:  </strong>You may review, change, or terminate your account at any time.</em></p>

      <p>
        If you are resident in the European Economic Area and you believe we are unlawfully processing your personal information, you also have the right to complain to your local data protection supervisory authority.
        You can find their contact details here: <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/bodies/authorities/index_en.htm">http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/bodies/authorities/index_en.htm</a>.

      <h5><strong><br>Account Information:</strong></h5>

      <p>
        If you would at any time like to review or change the information in your account or terminate your account, you can:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <em>Contact us using the contact information provided.</em>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Upon your request to terminate your account, we will deactivate or delete your account and information from our active databases.
        However, we may retain some information in our files to prevent fraud, troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigations, enforce our Terms of Use and/or comply with applicable legal requirements.
      </p>

      <h5><strong><br>Opting out of email marketing:</strong></h5>

      <p>
        You can unsubscribe from our marketing email list at any time by clicking on the unsubscribe link in the emails that we send or by contacting us using the details provided below.
        You will then be removed from the marketing email list – however, we may still communicate with you, for example to send you service-related emails that are necessary for the administration and use of your account, to respond to service
        requests, or for other non-marketing purposes.
        To otherwise opt-out, you may:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <em>Contact us using the contact information provided.</em>
        </li>

      <h3><strong>10. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</strong></h3>

      <p>
        Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems include a Do-Not-Track (“DNT”) feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored
        and collected.
        At this stage, no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized.
        As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online.
        If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy policy.

      <h3><strong>11. DO CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS HAVE SPECIFIC PRIVACY RIGHTS?</strong></h3>

      <p><em><strong>In Short:  </strong>Yes, if you are a resident of California, you are granted specific rights regarding access to your personal information.</em></p>

      <p>
        California Civil Code Section 1798.83, also known as the “Shine The Light” law, permits our users who are California residents to request and obtain from us, once a year and free of charge, information about categories of personal information
        (if any) we disclosed to third parties for direct marketing purposes and the names and addresses of all third parties with which we shared personal information in the immediately preceding calendar year.
        If you are a California resident and would like to make such a request, please submit your request in writing to us using the contact information provided below.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you are under 18 years of age, reside in California, and have a registered account with the App, you have the right to request removal of unwanted data that you publicly post on the App.
        To request removal of such data, please contact us using the contact information provided below, and include the email address associated with your account and a statement that you reside in California.
        We will make sure the data is not publicly displayed on the App, but please be aware that the data may not be completely or comprehensively removed from all our systems (e.g. backups, etc.).
      </p>
